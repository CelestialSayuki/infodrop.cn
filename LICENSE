By accessing, viewing, downloading, installing, compiling, executing, transmitting, or otherwise interacting with any portion of the Repository Content, you (hereinafter "the User") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and irrevocably agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this License. If you do not agree with any term of this License, you must immediately cease all interaction with the Repository Content.

1. Owner's Exclusive Rights and Permitted Uses

1.1. Exclusive Ownership: All Repository Content, in its entirety and any part thereof, along with all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and database rights, are and shall remain the exclusive and sole property of the Owner. The Owner reserves all rights not expressly and unambiguously granted to the User in this License.

1.2. Permitted Academic Research: Notwithstanding Section 1.3, the User is permitted to use the source code and compiled files from the Repository Content solely for non-commercial academic research purposes within an accredited educational or research institution. This permission does not extend to using, reproducing, or distributing any data from the Repository Content (including discussion forum data) without explicit written authorization from the Owner as per Section 3.1. Any publications or presentations resulting from such academic research must acknowledge the Owner and the Repository by including a clear citation and a link to the Repository.

1.3. Permitted Project Promotion: The User is permitted to inform others about the existence of this project and the Repository, provided that such communication exclusively serves to promote awareness of the project and includes a clear, functional link back to the official Repository. This permission does not allow for the distribution, reproduction, or use of any Repository Content itself, beyond linking to the Repository.

1.4. Strict Prohibition on Unauthorized Use: Unless explicitly, personally, and separately authorized by the Owner in a written agreement, signed by the Owner (beyond the specific permissions granted in Sections 1.2 and 1.3), the User is strictly and absolutely prohibited from engaging in any form of use, reproduction, distribution, public display, public performance, modification, adaptation, translation, reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, creation of derivative works, sublicensing, leasing, selling, renting, lending, or any other exploitation of the Repository Content for any purpose whatsoever, whether commercial or non-commercial. This prohibition extends to, but is not limited to:
* (a) Direct or indirect commercial exploitation of any kind.
* (b) Incorporation into any commercial or non-commercial product, service, or project.
* (c) Any form of redistribution, whether modified or unmodified, in source or compiled form.
* (d) Any form of network-based provision or hosting where the Repository Content or its output is accessible to third parties.

2. Presumption of Infringement

2.1. Evidentiary Presumption: Any use, reproduction, distribution, or creation of results, outputs, functionalities, compiled files, or derived works that are identical or substantially similar in form, function, or appearance to those generated from the Owner's source code or provided within the Repository Content, shall be conclusively presumed to be an infringement of the Owner's intellectual property rights.

2.2. Rebuttal Requirement: This presumption of infringement can only be rebutted if the User can conclusively demonstrate, with clear, convincing, and verifiable evidence (including, but not limited to, independent audit trails, detailed development logs, and expert testimony), that their implementation, results, or derived works were:
* (a) Developed entirely independently of the Repository Content, without any access to, reference to, or knowledge of the Repository Content; AND
* (b) Fundamentally different in their underlying creation, architecture, algorithms, or internal logic, and not merely a superficial alteration, re-styling, or re-implementation of the Owner's original concepts or designs.

Discussion Forum and Interaction Data Ownership: All data, information, ideas, suggestions, contributions, comments, and any other content shared, uploaded, posted, or transmitted by any User within the discussion forums, issue trackers, wikis, pull requests, or any other communication channels directly associated with the Repository, shall be deemed to be part of the Repository Content and shall become the sole and exclusive property of the Owner upon submission.

3.2. Strict Prohibition on Unauthorized Data Use: The User is strictly prohibited from collecting, extracting, copying, distributing, analyzing, or otherwise using any data from the Repository Content, including discussion forum data, for any purpose whatsoever, unless explicit, written, and separate authorization is obtained from the Owner. This prohibition applies even if the use is for academic research or non-commercial purposes. Viewing data within the Repository's intended interface for personal information gathering is permitted, but any processing, reproduction, or distribution requires specific consent.

4.3. Enforcement and Remedies: In the event of any actual or suspected violation of this License, the Owner reserves the right to pursue any and all available legal and equitable remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief, specific performance, and damages, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies the Owner may have. The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Owner from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from the User's breach of this License.
